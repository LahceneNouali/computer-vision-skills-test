# Extract Data From Graph

As researchers, students and engineers, we often face the problem of extracting data from graphs.

One of the proposed solutions is to use the ruler and the method of linear interpolation to extract this data,
but the problem is that this solution is tiring and inaccurate.

It is also possible to write to the researcher who did the examination and request this data from him,
but the problem is that it is not possible to guarantee that this researcher will respond to our request.

The solution was presented to us by Dr. Ankit Rohatgi through a program called WebPlotDigitizer,
this program works manually and automatically to extract data for any graph available in the form of an image.

The steps to run the program are as follows:

1. Introduction
2. Loading Images
3. 2D XY Plot and Axes Calibration
4. Manual Extraction Mode
5. Automatic Extraction Mode
	1. Mask
	2. Color Selection
	3. Averaging Window Algorithm
	4. X Step with Interpolation Algorithm
6. View and Export Digitized Data
7. Multiple Datasets
8. Distance Measurements with Maps and Microscope Images
9. Polar Diagram
10. Ternary Diagram
11. Using Dates in WebPlotDigitizer
